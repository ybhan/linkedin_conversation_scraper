## LinkedIn Conversation Message Scraper ##

This script will scrape the 20 most recent conversations from the messaging panel in LinkedIn web UI. The name and LinkedIn URL of the person and recent conversation history will be printed.

### Experiment Environment ###

- Python 3.7.2
  - Selenium 3.141.0
- Jupyter Notebook 6.0.2
  - IPython 7.10.1

Disclaimer: This scraper is effective at the time I experiment. But it may not work in the future since it highly relies on LinkedIn web UI elements (id, xpath, class, tag name, etc.).
